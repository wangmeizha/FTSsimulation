<!-- AgML Geometries are implemented within Modules.  Modules are the basic programming
     unit of AgML.  They provide  a contained namespace in which the user's detector
     is implemented.  The Module tag takes two attributes:  the name of the module and
     a comment string describing the module.  These are both mandatory.  Two additional
     pieces of information are also mandatory:  the author and date on which the module
     was created... -->
   <Author  name="A.N. Author" />
   <Created date="Today" />

   <!-- Next we need to take care of some backwards compatability issues.  We insert a tag
	a tag which instructs AgML to insert some common blocks into the geant 3 geometry
	which we may create.  The following is usually enough. -->
   <CDE>agecom,gcunit,gconst.</CDE>

   <!-- Next we declare the content of the module.  We list the names of all of the 
        volumes which we plan to define.  To maintain compatability with geant 3,
	we should limit our names to 4 characters, with no numbers or special characters.

        In this tutorial we will create two volumes:  A mother volume and a box.  It
	is good practice to use teh first four letters of the module's name as the name
	of the mother volume.

   <!-- Alright.  Let's get this ball rolling (so to speak).  We will create a mother
        volume and place it in the CAVE.  The volume will be declared below, but the
	code needed to create and position it must precede the declaration of volumes.
	-->
   
   <Create    block="TUTR" />
   <Placement block="TUTR" in="CAVE" />

   <!-- The Create operator is responsible for creating the volume.  The Placement
        operator instructs AgML to place the volume into a second volume... in this
	case, the CAVE.  If you omit the "in" attribute above, the default parent 
	will be the volume which created it.  When the create operator is invoked
	from inside a module (instead of a volume), the dfault is the CAVE. 

        Let's go ahead and define our volume.

   -->

   <Volume name="TUTR" comment="Main volume in the AGML tutorial geometry">
     <!-- 

     Like modules, volumes require a name and a documentation string.  The documentation
     string should be a short descriptive statement about the volume.  Feel free to add
     additinal documentation as you go.  Remember... after you leave the collaboration, it
     will fall to someone else to maitain ad debug your geometry.  It's far easier to figure
     out what the code is supposed to do if you tell them what you're trying to achieve. 

     -->

     <Material  name="Air"      /> 
     <Medium    name="Standard" />
     <Attribute seen="0"        />
     <!-- 

     Typically the first volume in a module will be a virtual volume, defined simply as a
     shape filled with air.  You probably don't want it to be seen, and unless you need
     to change the behavior of the physics simulation, you'll want the standard medium.

     -->

     <Shape type="Box" dx="500.0" dy="500.0" dz="500.0" />
     <!--

     You can often omit the material, medium and/or attribute definitions above.
     But every volume requires a shape.  In this case, we're creating a box with
     half-widths of 500 cm in x, y and z.

     Once we have declared the shape, we can create and position daughter volumes.

     -->

     <Create    block="ABOX" />   <!-- create the box volume -->
     <Placement block="ABOX" />   <!-- place the box volume --> 

     <!--

      Now that we've created the box and placed it once, let's try placing multiple
      copies within the tutorial volume.  The syntax looks like this.  Play around
      a bit with placement before moving onto the next tutorial.

      <Placement block="ABOX" z="z-position"  />

      <Placement block="ABOX" x="x-position"   >
          <Rotation alphax="x-rotation angle" />
          <Rotation alphay="y-rotationn angle" />
      </Placement>

       -->
         

   </Volume>

 
   <Volume name="ABOX" comment="A volume which is a box in the tutorial">


     <Attribute seen="1" colo="4" />
     <!-- 
     When we omit the material, medium and/or attribute operator, the properties
     are inherited from the volume which created it.
     -->

     <Shape type="Box" dx="10" dy="10" dz="10" />
